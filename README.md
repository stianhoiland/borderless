## Credits

My girlfriend who made the beautiful icon.

Originally I was inspired to create this when [teutinsa](https://github.com/teutinsa) [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/1gyapb9) their own borderless utility on [r/C_Programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming). I got sidetracked and ended up creating [trayutil](https://github.com/stianhoiland/trayutil) instead, which is just a project template for any Win32 tray utility, where the sample app just happens to be a borderless window utility. trayutil solves the same problems that teutinsa's [BorderlessGaming](https://github.com/teutinsa/BorderlessGaming) utility does, but in ways more to my liking, yet I was unhappy with the approach in general. So, I restarted the project and instead finally made the world's smallest borderless window utility. The rest is history.
